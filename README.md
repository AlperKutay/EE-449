## Homework 1 - Training Artificial Neural Network

In this homework, you will perform experiments on artificial neural network (ANN) training and draw
conclusions from the experimental results. You will partially implement and train multi layer perceptron
(MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers on CIFAR-10 dataset [1]. The implementations will be in Python language and you will be using PyTorch [2] and NumPy [3]. You can visit the
link provided in the references [2, 3] to understand the usage of the libraries.

## Homework 2 - Evolutionary Algorithms
In this homework, you will perform experiments on evolutionary algorithm and draw conclusions from
the experimental results. The task is to create an image made of filled circles, visually similar to a given
RGB source image (painting.png).
The implementations will be in Python language and you will be using OpenCV package to draw the
images.
